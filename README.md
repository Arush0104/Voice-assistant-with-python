# Voice-assistant-with-python
basic voice assistant with python
Note: As of 14-12-2018 pyaudio is not supported in python 3.7 and above.
So you will have to downgrade the version of python for it to work.
PS: Install the following dependencies to work with this project 
Speech_Recognition(pip install speech_recognition)
pyttsx3(pip install pyttsx3)
wikipedia(pip install wikipedia)
the rest of the dependencies are already pre-installed.
